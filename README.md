# CSE557A-Assignment2

The prototype can currently show the path for a given carId for an input time range.
This path is not currently scaled/adjusted to fit the kronos map properly

# Bugs
For some reason, SVG height is set to 6 randomly
The converted abila.json from the shape files projects really small onto the svg, so help scaling it up is needed

# FeaturesToAdd
Still need to compare multiple cars
Add color gradient to signify different day
